The code defines a schema for the sample data, which represents a collection of users, and creates a Mongoose model for it. The model is used to query the database to retrieve data for the specified API routes.

The API routes are defined using the app.get() method and correspond to the different queries that the frontend application will make to the server.

The first route, /api/users/income-bmw-mercedes, retrieves all users who have an income lower than $5 USD and a car of brand BMW or Mercedes.

The second route, /api/users/male-phone-price, retrieves all male users who have a phone with a price greater than $10,000 USD.

The third route, /api/users/last-name-email, retrieves all users whose last name starts with "M", has a quote character length greater than 15 and their email includes their last name.

The fourth route, /api/users/bmw-mercedes-audi-email, retrieves all users who have a car of brand BMW, Mercedes or Audi and whose email does not include any digit.

The fifth route, /api/cities/top-10, retrieves the top 10 cities with the highest number of users and their average income. It uses an aggregation pipeline to group the users by city and calculate the count and average income for each group.

Finally, the server is started on the specified port and a message is printed to the console to indicate that it is listening for requests.
